Data collection from wearables raises questions about data ownership.
Insurers may use health data for risk assessment and premium adjustments.
Security risks exist, including potential data breaches and misuse of personal health information.

Not everyone can afford fitness trackers, gym memberships, or healthier food options.
The program may create a gap between low-risk individuals who benefit and high-risk individuals who face higher costs.
Ethical Concerns

Could lead to discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions.
May penalize people who cannot engage in physical activities due to disabilities or chronic health issues.
Premium adjustments could unfairly favor already healthy individuals.
Reliability of Tracking Systems

Wearables and tracking devices are not always accurate, leading to potential miscalculations.
Some individuals may attempt to manipulate or cheat tracking systems.
System errors could result in policyholders receiving incorrect rewards or penalties.
Real-World Privacy Issues

In February 2024, Prudential experienced a data breach affecting over 2.5 million individuals. Compromised data included names, addresses, and driver's license numbers.
