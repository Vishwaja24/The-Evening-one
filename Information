### **Implications for Incentive-Based Models**

These incidents highlight the potential risks associated with collecting and storing personal health data in incentive-based life insurance models:

- **Data Sensitivity:** Health data from wearables and apps is highly personal. Breaches could lead to misuse or unauthorized sharing of this information.

- **Trust Erosion:** Repeated breaches can diminish policyholder trust in insurers' ability to protect their data, potentially reducing engagement in health programs.

- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Significant breaches attract attention from regulators, leading to potential fines and stricter compliance requirements.

By discussing these real-world examples, you can emphasize the critical importance of robust data security measures in maintaining policyholder trust and ensuring the success of incentive-based life insurance programs.
